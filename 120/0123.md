*Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Eighth State of the Union Address*

*富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福的第八次国情咨文演说*

…………

Even when the World War broke out in 1914, it seemed to contain only small threat of danger to our own American future. But, as time went on, the American people began to visualize what the downfall of democratic nations might mean to our own democracy.

世界大战在一九一四年骤然爆发的时候，这场战争对我们美国本身的前途似乎仅有轻微的威胁。但是，随着时间的推移，美国人民开始体会到各民主国家的沦陷对我们美国的民主制度会意味着什么。

We need not overemphasize imperfections in the Peace of Versailles. We need not harp on failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world reconstruction. We should remember that the Peace of 1919 was far less unjust than the kind of "pacification" which began even before Munich, and which is being carried on under the new order of tyranny that seeks to spread over every continent today. The American people have unalterably set their faces against that tyranny.

我们无须过分强调凡尔赛和约的缺陷。我们也无须反覆谈论各民主国家处理世界性破坏问题的失效。我们应该记住，一九一九年的和约与早在慕尼黑会议以前就开始的「和解」相比，其不公正的程度要小得多；而在那力图向世界各大洲扩展的暴政新秩序下，这种「和解」仍在延续着。美国人民坚定不移地反对那种暴政。

Every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being' directly assailed in every part of the world—assailed either by arms, or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nations that are still at peace.

每一个现实主义者都知道，民主的生活方式目前正在世界各地遭到直接的进攻——或者是武力的进攻，或者是秘密散布的恶毒宣传的进攻。散布这种宣传的是那些企图在仍然维持着和平的国家中破坏团结挑起不和的人。十六个月来，这种进攻已在数目惊人的一批大小独立国家中毁掉了整个民主生活的方式。进攻者仍在步步进逼，威胁着大大小小的其它国家。

…………

Therefore, as your President, performing my constitutional duty to "give to the Congress information of the state of the Union," I find it, unhappily, necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders.

作为你们的总统，执行宪法加诸于我的「向国会报导联邦情况」的责任，我认为必须向你们报告，我们国家和我们民主政治的前途与安全，已经和远离我们国境的许多事件不可抗拒地牵连在一起了。

Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents. If that defense fails, all the population and all the resources of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia will be dominated by the conquerors. Let us remember that the total of those populations and their resources in those four continents greatly exceeds the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere-many times over.

以武力保卫民主生存的战争，现正在四大洲英勇地进行。倘若这场保卫战失败，所有在欧洲、亚洲、非洲和澳洲的人口和一切资源，均将为征服者所控制。这些人口和资源合计起来，远超过整个西半球的全部人口和资源的总数——超过很多倍。

…………

No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion -or even good business.

任何现实的美国人都不能期望从一个独裁者的和平中获得国际上的宽容，或真正独立的恢复，或世界性裁军，或言论自由，或宗教信仰自由，或者甚至公平的贸易。

Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. "Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."

这样的和平决不会给我们或者我们的邻国带来任何安全。「那些宁愿放弃基本自由以求一时安全的人；既不该享有自由，也不该得到安全。」

…………

I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war.

我最近曾指出，现代战争可以多么迅速地将武器攻击带到我们的身旁，如果独裁国家打赢这场战争，我们就必须预计到这种攻击的到来。

…………

The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily-almost exclusively—to meeting this foreign peril. For all our domestic problems are now a part of the great emergency.

当务之急是，我们的行动和我们的政策都应首先针对(几乎是专门针对)如何对付这种来自国外的危险，因为我们所有的国内问题现在都已成为这一逼近眉睫的问题的一个部分。

Just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all our fellow men within our gates, so our national policy in foreign affairs has been based on a decent respect for the rights and dignity of all nations, large and small. And the justice of morality must and will win in the end.

正如在国内事务上，我们的国策是以尊重国门以内所有同胞的权利和尊严的基础，在外交事务上，我们的国策也以尊重所有大小国家的权利与尊严为依归。道德的公正原则最后将会并且也必然会获得胜利。

Our national policy is this:

我们的国策是：

First, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to all-inclusive national defense.

第一，在明确表达公众意愿以及排除党派偏见的情况下，我们致力于全面的国防。

Second, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to full support of all those resolute peoples, everywhere, who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our Hemisphere. By this support, we express our determination that the democratic cause shall prevail; and we strengthen the defense and the security of our own nation.

第二，在明确表达公众意愿以及排除党派偏见的情况下，我们决定对于任何地方反抗侵略致使战火没有燃到我们西半球来的所有英勇民族，予以全力支持。我们用这种支持，来表示我们对民主事业必胜的决心；我们要加强我国本身的防御和安全。

Third, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers. We know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom.

第三，在明确表达公众意愿以及排除党派偏见的情况下，我们决定声明，道德的基本原则和我们对本身安全的考虑，将永不容许我们默认由侵略者所支配和「和解」主义者所赞许的和平。我们知道，持久和平是不能以他人的自由为代价买来的。

…………

New circumstances are constantly begetting new needs for our safety. I shall ask this Congress for greatly increased new appropriations and authorizations to carry on what we have begun.

新情况不断为我们的安全带来新的需要。我将要求国会大量增加新的拨款并授权继续进行我们已开始的工作。

I also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations.

我也要求本届国会授予足够的权力与经费，以便制造多种多样的额外军需品与战争装备，供给那些现已与侵略国实际作战的国家。

Our most useful and immediate role is to act as an arsenal for them as well as for ourselves. They do not need man power, but they do need billions of dollars worth of the weapons of defense.

我们最有效和最直接的任务，是充当他们和我们自己的兵工厂。他们不需人力，他们所需的是价值以十亿美元计的防卫武器。

The time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready cash. We cannot, and we will not, tell them that they must surrender, merely because of present inability to pay for the weapons which we know they must have.

用不了多久，他们将无力用现款偿付这些防御武器。我们不能也不会只因为他们无力偿付我们知道他们必须拥有的武器，便告诉他们必须投降。

I do not recommend that we make them a loan of dollars with which to pay for these weapons—a loan to be repaid in dollars.

我不会建议由我们贷款给他们，再由他们用该款支付购买武器的费用——一种需用现金偿还的贷款。

I recommend that we make it possible for those nations to continue to obtain war materials in the United States, fitting their orders into our own program. Nearly all their materiel would, if the time ever came, be useful for our own defense.

我建议由我们设法使那些国家继续从美国取得作战物资，并使他们的定单与我们自己的计划配合起来。一旦时刻到来，他们的几乎全部军用物资都会有利于我们自己的防卫。

Taking counsel of expert military and naval authorities, considering what is best for our own security, we are free to decide how much should be kept here and how much should be sent abroad to our friends who by their determined and heroic resistance are giving us time in which to make ready our own defense.

根据富有经验的陆海军权威的建议，并且考虑到什么是最有利于我们自身安全，我们可以自由地决定应该在国内保留多少，应该运给我们的外国朋友多少。他们坚定英勇抗敌，使我们赢得时间为我们自己的防卫作准备。

…………

Let us say to the democracies: "We Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom. We are putting forth our energies, our resources and our organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world. We shall send you, in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns. This is our purpose and our pledge."

让我们对民主国家申明：「我们美国人极为关怀你们保卫自由的战争。我们正使用我们的实力、我们的资源和我们的组织力量，使你们有能力恢复和维系一个自由的世界。我们会给你们送来数量日增的舰艇、飞机、坦克和大炮。这是我们的目标，也是我们的誓言。」

In fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the threats of dictators that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their aggression. Such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be.

为了实现这个目标，我们不会因独裁者的威胁而退缩不前，这些人认为我们对那些胆敢抵抗他们侵略的民主国家进行支援，是违犯国际公法，是战争行为。

…………

The happiness of future generations of Americans may well depend upon how effective and how immediate we can make our aid felt. No one can tell the exact character of the emergency situations that we may be called upon to meet. The Nation's hands must not be tied when the Nation's life is in danger.

未来几代美国人的幸福，可能要看我们如何有效而迅速地使我们的支援产生影响而定。没有人知道，我们要面对的紧急处境是属于怎样一种性质。在国家命脉临危的时候，国家的双手绝对不能受缚。

We must all prepare to make the sacrifices that the emergency-almost as serious as war itself—demands. Whatever stands in the way of speed and efficiency in defense preparations must give way to the national need.

我们全体都必须准备为那种和战争本身一样严重的非常时期的要求，作出牺牲。任何阻碍迅速而有效地进行防卫准备的事，都必须为国家的需要让路。

…………

As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone. Those who man our defenses, and those behind them who build our defenses, must have the stamina and the courage which come from unshakable belief in the manner of life which they are defending. The mighty action that we are calling for cannot be based on a disregard of all things worth fighting for.

如同人们并非单靠面包生活一样，他们也并非单靠武器来作战。那些坚守我们防御工事的人以及在他们后面建立防御工事的人必须具有耐力和勇气，而所有这些均来自对他们正在保卫的生活方式所抱的不可动摇的信念。我们所号召的伟大行动，是不可能以忽视所有值得奋斗的东西为基础的。

The Nation takes great satisfaction and much strength from the things which have been done to make its people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in America. Those things have toughened the fibre of our people, have renewed their faith and strengthened their devotion to the institutions we make ready to protect.

美国民主生活的保持是与个人利害攸关的，举国上下，对于促使人民明白这一点而做的种种事情，都非常满意，并且从中汲取了巨大力量。那些事情使我们人民的气质坚强起来，重建了他们的信心，也加强了他们对大家准备保卫的各种制度的忠诚。

Certainly this is no time for any of us to stop thinking about the social and economic problems which are the root cause of the social revolution which is today a supreme factor in the world.

当然，现在并非停止考虑各种社会和经济问题的时候，这些问题都是社会革命的根本原因，而这种革命则是今天世界的一个主要因素。

For there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy. The basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple. They are:

一个健全巩固的民主政治的基础并不神秘。我们人民对政治和经济制度所抱的基本期望十分简单。它们是：

Equality of opportunity for youth and for others.

给青年和其他人以均等机会；

Jobs for those who can work.

给能工作的人以工作；

Security for those who need it.

给需要保障的人以保障；

The ending of special privilege for the few.

终止少数人享有的特权；

The preservation of civil liberties for all.

保护所有人的公民自由权；

The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living.

在生活水平更普遍和不断提高的情况下，享受科学进步的成果。

These are the simple, basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world. The inner and abiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectations.

在我们这个混乱和极端复杂的现代世界中，这些是决不应忽视的简单而基本的事项。我们的各种经济和政治体制的内在和持久的力量，取决于它们满足这些期望的程度。

Many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement.

有不少与我们社会经济有关的事项，需要立即改善。

As examples:

例如：

We should bring more citizens under the coverage of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance.

我们应当使更多的公民得到老年退休金和失业保险的保障。

We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care.

我们应当扩大那种使人们得到充分医疗照顾的机会。

We should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful employment may obtain it.

我们应当制订一套更好的制度，使那些应当并需要获得有薪职业的人们能够就业。

I have called for personal sacrifice. I am assured of the willingness of almost all Americans to respond to that call.

我曾经号召大家作个人的牺牲。我已得到保证，几乎每个美国人都心甘情愿响应我这个号召。

…………

In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.

在我们力求安定的未来的岁月里，我们期待一个建立在四项人类基本自由之上的世界。

The first is freedom of speech and expression—everywhere in the world.

第一是在全世界任何地方发表言论和表达意见的自由。

The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world.

第二是在全世界任何地方，人人有以自己的方式来崇拜上帝的自由。

The third is freedom from want—which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world.

第三是不虞匮乏的自由——这种自由，就世界范围来讲，就是一种经济上的融洽关系，它将保证全世界每一个国家的居民都过健全的、和平时期的生活。

The fourth is freedom from fear—which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor—anywhere in the world.

第四是免除恐惧的自由——这种自由，就世界范围来讲，就是世界性的裁减军备，要以一种彻底的方法把它裁减到这样的程度：务使世界上没有一个国家有能力向全世界任何地区的任何邻国进行武力侵略。

That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.

这并不是对一个渺茫的黄金时代的憧憬，而是我们这个时代和我们这一代人可以实现的一种世界的坚实基础，这种世界，和独裁者想用炸弹爆炸来制造的所谓「新秩序」的暴政，是截然相反的。

To that new order we oppose the greater conception—the moral order. A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear.

对于他们那个新秩序，我们是以一种伟大的观念——道德秩序来与之相对抗的。一个优越的社会，是可以同样毫无畏惧地面对各种征服世界和在国外制造革命的阴谋的。

Since the beginning of our American history, we have been engaged in change—in a perpetual peaceful revolution—a revolution which goes on steadily, quietly adjusting itself to changing conditions—without the concentration camp or the quick-lime in the ditch. The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly, civilized society.

自美国有史以来，我们一直在从事改革——一种永久性的和平革命——一种连续不断而静悄悄地适应环境变化的革命——并不需要任何集中营或万人冢。我们所追求的世界秩序，是自由国家间的合作，以及在友好、文明的社会里共同努力。

This nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women; and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God. Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere. Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them. Our strength is our unity of purpose. To that high concept there can be no end save victory.

这个国家，已把它的命运交到它千百万自由男女的手里，脑里和心里；把它对于自由的信仰交由上帝指引。自由意味着在任何地方人权都是至高无上的。凡是为了取得或保持这种权利而斗争的人，我们都予以支持。我们的力量来自我们的目标一致。为了实现这一崇高的观念，我们是不获全胜绝不休止的。
